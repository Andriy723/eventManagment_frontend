# eventManagment_frontend
The front end part for test task. EventManager - a cite for creating, managing, searching all events.
You can controle all the events that you created. You can see the recommandations in the deatail view page. The UI is brilliant. You can watch the events, edit them and event share them with your friends. On a cite you can also watch where the event is held and even lay a route to the point.  

# Getting Started with EventManager

This was created as a test task.

### Before the installation, you need to do a console command:
### `cd event-mangement-frontend`

# Starting the installation:

### 1. Firstly you need to install all dependencies using:

### `npm install`

### 2. To run the app in the development mode use this command:

### `npm run dev`

### 3. To run it in ordinary mode, run this command:

### `npm start`

### 4. This run the build:

### `npm run build`
## Interesting things that happened to me during the task:

The WebStorm on the front end part just couldn't find the branch and after I added the branch I needed, I come across another problem - Git couldn't compare the branches in order to merge. And the solution was just to copy all the files from the project and to create another folder with the name of the project - that folder was named as previous but git find this as a different project and I finally merge the branch with a new folder.
