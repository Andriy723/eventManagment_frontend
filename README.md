# Getting Started with EventManager

This was created as a test task.

### Before the installation, you need to do a console command:
### `cd event-mangement-frontend`

### Starting the installation:

### 1. Firstly you need to install all dependencies using:

### `npm install`

### 2. To run the app in the development mode use this command:

### `npm run dev`

### 3. To run it in ordinary mode, run this command:

### `npm start`

### 4. This run the build:

### `npm run build`


## Interesting things that happened to me during the task:

I had a problem with dependencies. In the package.json I wrote the version 
of tailwindcss as ^3.*" and this
version is on demo. So, basically I just spend at least 30 minutes to find
this bug, 'cause all the styles didn't work. I`m so glad that I have found this bug.
